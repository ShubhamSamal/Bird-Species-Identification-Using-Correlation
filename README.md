# Bird-Species-Identification-Using-Correlation
• The project uses correlation concept to match the recorded bird sound power spectrum with the power spectrum of few power spectrums which have already been calculated. 
• It returns a match if the particular species is present in our data vector. 
• User Interface was created using MATLAB to visualize details of the identified species.
